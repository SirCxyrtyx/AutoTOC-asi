# AutoTOC-asi

Will automatically generate all the PCConsoleTOC.bin files for the original Mass Effect 3 and the Mass Effect Legendary Edition games, every time the game starts up. This is made primarily for modders, so they don't have to remember to manually run AutoTOC everytime they update some files. Just install this and forget that TOC files even exist. Works invisibly and doesn't add any noticeable amount of time to startup.

**Installation:**

Mass Effect 3 Version:
Requires [ErikJS's binkw32 dlls](https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32/releases/tag/r4)

Put those in your Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32 folder, then create a folder there called ASI, and put [this](https://github.com/SirCxyrtyx/AutoTOC-asi/releases/download/v1.0/AutoTOC.asi) in it.

Legendary Edition Version:

Still in development. Installation instructions will be added once it works.
