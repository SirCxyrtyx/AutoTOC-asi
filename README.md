# AutoTOC-asi

Will automatically generate all the PCConsoleTOC.bin files that Mass Effect 3 needs, every time the game starts up.


**Installation:**

Requires [ErikJS's binkw32 dlls](https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32/releases/tag/r4)

Put those in your Mass Effect 3\Binaries\Win32 folder, then create a folder there called ASI, and put this in it.
